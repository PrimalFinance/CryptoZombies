## Directions

<small>
Great, now we can implement SafeMath on all the types of uints we used in our DApp!

Let's fix all those potential issues in ZombieAttack. (There was also one zombies[_zombieId].level++; that needed to be fixed in ZombieHelper, but we've taken care of that one for you so we don't take an extra chapter to do so ðŸ˜‰).

Putting it to the Test
Go ahead and implement SafeMath methods on all the ++ increments in ZombieAttack. We've left comments in the code to make them easy to find.
