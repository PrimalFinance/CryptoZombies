## Directions

<small>
Great! That was the difficult part â€” now implementing the external transferFrom function will be easy, since our _transfer function already does almost all the heavy lifting.

## Putting it to the Test

First, we want to make sure only the owner or the approved address of a token/zombie can transfer it. Let's define a mapping called zombieApprovals. It should map a uint to an address. This way, when someone that is not the owner calls transferFrom with a \_tokenId, we can use this mapping to quickly look up if he is approved to take that token.

Next, let's add a require statement to transferFrom. It should make sure that only the owner or the approved address of a token/zombie can transfer it.

Lastly, don't forget to call \_transfer.

Note: Checking that only the owner or the approved address of a token/zombie can transfer it means that at least one of these conditions must be true:

zombieToOwner for \_tokenId is equal to msg.sender

or

zombieApprovals for \_tokenId is equal to msg.sender

Don't worry about filling in data in the zombieApprovals mapping, we'll do it in the next chapter.
